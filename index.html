<h3>A PUP Timeline:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2010</strong> PUP forms in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with a since-constant lineup of Stefan Babcock (lead vocals, guitar), Steve Sladkowski (guitar), Nestor Chumak (bass), and Zack Mykula (drums).</li>
    <li><strong>Sept 2013</strong> PUP debuts the music video for their song "Reservoir," depicting the chaos of life as a touring band.</li>
    <li><strong>Dec 2013</strong> PUP self-released their debut album <em>PUP</em>, later re-released in 2014 on SideOneDummy Records.</li>
    <li><strong>2015</strong> A heavy touring schedule puts strain on Babcock's voice, forcing PUP to cancel several shows. A doctor examines Babcock's vocal chords and bluntly tells him, "The dream is over."</li>
    <li><strong>Feb-Mar 2016</strong> PUP debuts music videos "DVP" and "If This Tour Doesn't Kill You, I Will," to promote their upcoming second album.</li>
    <li><strong>May 2016</strong> PUP releases their second album <em>The Dream is Over</em>, named after the earlier scare over Babcock's musical career.</li>
    <li><strong>Jan 2019</strong> PUP announces their third album <em>Morbid Stuff</em>, to be released on their newly-founded label Little Dipper Records.</li>
    <li><strong>Feb 2019</strong> PUP shares a lyric sheet and chord chat with their newsletter subscribers for a new song called "Free At Last," encouraging fans to post cover versions of the unreleased track. Samples from the 253 fan submissions are later featured in the "Free At Last" music video.</li>
    <li><strong>Mar 2019</strong> PUP's third album <em>Morbid Stuff</em>is released on Little Dipper Records. Album preorders are shipped in bundles of unusual band merch, including PUP backpacks, emergency kits, and inflatable lifeboats.</li>
    <li><strong>Jul 2020</strong>PUP promotes a one-day only release of a live album from a November 2019 performance in London. All proceeds from the live album are donated to civil rights organizations.</li>
    <li><strong>Oct 2020</strong> PUP releases their first EP <em>This Place Sucks Ass</em>, promoting the album with an online livestream concert from a Toronto venue titled "This Stream Sucks Ass: The PUP the Band Livestream Experience."</li>
