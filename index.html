        <h3>A Morbid Timeline:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2010</strong> - PUP (originally named Topanga) forms in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with a lineup of Stefan Babcock (lead vocals, guitar), Steve Sladkowski (guitar), Nestor Chumak (bass), and Zack Mykula (drums).</li>
          <li><strong>December 2010</strong> - PUP (as Topanga) releases a 4-track EP for free digital download.
          <li><strong>Sept 2013</strong> - PUP’s music video debut “Reservoir” is posted to YouTube, depicting the chaotic lifestyle of a touring band.         </li>
          <li><strong>Dec 2013</strong> - PUP self-releases their debut album <em>PUP</em>, later reissued in the United States in 2014 on SideOneDummy records.</li>
          <li><strong>December 2015</strong> - Babcock’s voice is put under strain by PUP’s intensive touring schedule, and the band is forced to cancel several shows. A doctor examines his damaged vocal cords and tells him, “The dream is over.”</li>
          <li><strong>Feb-Mar 2016</strong> - PUP debuts music videos for the songs “If This Tour Doesn’t Kill You, I Will” and “DVP” to their YouTube channel to promote an upcoming second album.</li>
          <li><strong>May 2016</strong> - PUP releases their second album <em>The Dream is Over</em>, named in reference to Babcock’s vocal health scare on the previous tour.</li>
          <li><strong>Jul-Dec 2016</strong> - <em>The Dream is Over</em> achieves critical and commercial success, earning the band a nomination for the Canadian Polaris Music Prize and a mention in Rolling Stone’s “Best Music Videos of 2016” for “Sleep in the Heat.”</li>
          <li><strong>Jan 2019</strong> - PUP announces their upcoming third album <em>Morbid Stuff</em>, to be released on their newly-formed label Little Dipper Records.</li>
          <li><strong>Feb 2019</strong> - PUP provides zine subscribers with a lyric sheet and chord chart for their upcoming single “Free At Last,” challenging fans to record their interpretation of the unreleased song. Excerpts from the 253 fan submissions are later featured in the “Free At Last” music video.</li>
          <li><strong>Mar 2019</strong> - PUP’s third album <em>Morbid Stuff</em> is released on Little Dipper Records. Album pre-orders are shipped with an eccentric line of band merch including PUP backpacks, emergency kits and inflatable lifeboats.
