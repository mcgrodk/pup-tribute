<h3>A Timeline of PUP:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2010</strong> PUP forms in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with a since-constant lineup of Stefan Babcock (lead vocals, guitar), Steve Sladkowski (guitar), Nestor Chumak (bass), and Zack Mykula (drums).</li>
    <li><strong>Sept. 2013</strong> PUP debuts the music video for their song "Reservoir," depicting the chaos of life as a touring band.</li>
    <li><strong>Dec. 2013</strong> PUP self-released their debut album <em>PUP</em>, later re-released in 2014 on SideOneDummy Records.</li>
    <li><strong>2015</strong> A heavy touring schedule puts strain on Babcock's voice, forcing PUP to cancel several shows. A doctor examines Babcock's vocal chords and bluntly tells him, "The dream is over."</li>
    <li><strong>Feb.-Mar. 2016</strong> PUP debuts music videos "DVP" and "If This Tour Doesn't Kill You, I Will," to promote their upcoming second album.</li>
    <li><strong>May 2016</strong> PUP releases their second album <em>The Dream is Over</em>, named after the earlier scare over Babcock's musical career.</li>
